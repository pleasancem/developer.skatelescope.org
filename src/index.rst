Welcome to the `Square Kilometre Array <http://www.skatelescope.org>`_ software
documentation portal. Whether you are a developer involved in SKA or you are
simply one of our many users, all of our software processes and projects are
documented in this portal.

Scope
=====

This documentation applies to the bridging phase of the SKA project, further
updates and scope changes will be published on this website.
Part of the bridging phase goals will be to consolidate and enrich this portal
with more detailed information. It is thus anticipated that in this phase
the change rate of the documentation will be very frequent.
